# HemeLB-GPU: GPU Acceleration of the HemeLB code
This repository contains a GPU-accelerated version of the HemeLB lattice Boltzmann code for large scale fluid flow in complex geometries.

# Authors
The initial version of the CUDA kernel was implemented by Benjamin T. Shealy, Ashwin T. Srinath, and [Ulf D. Schiller](https://cecas.clemson.edu/compmat/) during the OLCF GPU Hackathon 2018. Mehrdad Yousefi helped setting up test geometries for benchmarks.
